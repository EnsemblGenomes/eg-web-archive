<p>Oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) was formed ~7500 years ago by hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea, followed by chromosome doubling, a process known as allopolyploidy. Together with more ancient polyploidizations, this conferred an aggregate 72Ã— genome multiplication since the origin of angiosperms and high gene content.</p>

<p>The final assembly of 849.7 Mb was obtained using<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->SOAP<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->and Newbler, with 89% nongapped sequence.<!--nbsp--> <!--nbsp-->The assembly covers ~79% of the 1130-Mb genome and includes 95.6% of Brassica expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map genetically anchored 712.3 Mb (84%) of the genome assembly, yielding pseudomolecules for the 19 chromosomes.</p>
